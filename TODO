TODO

 * Make callbacks node-standard ... last arg callback, err first arg of the callback: (a, b..., callback) -> callback([c,d] = b)
 * Add "inputs" step in Map/Reduce building - and just run(callback)
 * Deal with vclocks, exposing and solving conflicts
 * Resilent to crashes, network errors, etc; auto-reconnect to several hosts
 * Provide an accurate clientId, bound to environment? - randomizing it on client init is a bad solution
 * Test with vows / merge airline tests and introduce fake passengers with faker
 * Make jQuery version work and fix #6
