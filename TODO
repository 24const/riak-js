TODO

 * HTTP-specific tests + documentation (copy from riak.js)
 * Incorporate ideas from http://github.com/jamesaduncan/riak-js
 * Add "inputs" step in Map/Reduce building - and just run(callback)
 * Deal with vclocks, exposing and solving conflicts
 * Update in node wiki
 * Resilent to crashes, network errors, etc; auto-reconnect to several hosts
 * Provide an accurate clientId, bound to environment? - randomizing it on client init is a bad solution
 * Test with vows / merge airline tests and introduce fake passengers with faker
 * Make jQuery version work and fix #6
