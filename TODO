TODO

=> check http://bitbucket.org/basho/wriaki
=> Much better, exhaustive testing - like Ripple

LIB 1: riak-js-client-pool

  * riak-js/HTTP no longer features a connection pool; request order is guaranteed, no race conditions
  * An external library would be handy to provide a client pool:
    - In case you want to perform multiple requests at once
    - Should take care of automatically reconnecting to other nodes in the cluster when a node is down

LIB2: riak-js-mapper

  * An ODM or whatever you wanna name it. Just like LearnBoost/mongoose or Ripple

NICE TO HAVES

  * meaningful (bound to env) clientId => need to know how to make a synchronous call to get `hostname`
  * Bugfix: (Riak?) protobuf stores usermeta in headers without X-Riak-Meta- prefix -- this causes interop problems
  * Support keep-alive connections
  * Test with vows / merge airline tests and introduce fake passengers with faker
  * http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/compare/4737d67...ed9a65e -- riak_kv_test_backend
  * Support streaming API / support chunked data from Riak (chunked Map/Reduce and keys streaming, others?)
