riak-js 1.0

 - javascript so that more people can contribute, and better debug in production
 - make it generic, but no support for protobuf -- patches accepted
 - should be suitable for client side impl (pure js)
 - accept streams whenever possible (for logging, map/reduce, luwak, key listing)
 - key listing should *always* stream, client will do buffering
 - test everything: seq + assert; use test backend
 - drop riakjs.org, put docs in README
 - new BSD license
 - hooks: onpresave('users')
 - conflict resolution strategies (see java client)
 
META

 - simplified
 - has shortcuts (contentType, links, r, etc)
 - the non-recognized ones will simply be ignored
 - extra http headers can be passed in via `headers` (for instance custom usermeta, `X-Riak-Meta-*`). these *will* override whatever has been set elsewhere
